## Postman Collection

Import this JSON into Postman for easy testing:

```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "WorkerConnect API",
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "Health Check",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "http://localhost:3001/health"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Worker Register",
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://localhost:3001/api/worker/register",
        "header": [{"key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json"}],
        "body": {
          "mode": "raw",

## Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

### Check Worker Registration

```sql
SELECT * FROM worker ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Establishment Registration

```sql
SELECT * FROM establishment ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Attendance Records

```sql
SELECT 
    a.*,
    w.full_name as worker_name,
    e.establishment_name
FROM attendance a
JOIN worker w ON a.worker_id = w.worker_id
JOIN establishment e ON a.establishment_id = e.establishment_id
ORDER BY a.check_in_date_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Active Workers at Establishments

```sql
SELECT 
    e.establishment_name,
    COUNT(ew.estmt_worker_id) as total_workers
FROM establishment e
LEFT JOIN establishment_worker ew ON e.establishment_id = ew.establishment_id 
    AND ew.status = 'active'
GROUP BY e.establishment_id, e.establishment_name;
```

## Common Issues

### 400 Bad Request
- Check request body format
- Verify all required fields are provided
- Validate data types (numbers as numbers, not strings)

### 401 Unauthorized
- Check Authorization header is included
- Verify token format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
- Token might be expired (default: 7 days)

### 404 Not Found
- Verify endpoint URL is correct
- Check if backend is running on port 3001

### 500 Internal Server Error
- Check backend console for error details
- Verify database connection
- Check Supabase credentials in .env

## Performance Testing

Test with multiple concurrent requests:

```bash
# Install apache bench
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

# Test 100 requests with 10 concurrent
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:3001/health
```
